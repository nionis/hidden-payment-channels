# Title

HiddenPay

# Short Description

HiddenPay is a privacy-preserving micropayment SDK that enables anonymous, efficient billing for services like RPC nodes and GPT models.

# Long Description

HiddenPay addresses a critical gap in decentralized finance and services: the lack of truly private micropayment mechanisms for pay-as-you-use models, such as RPC providers, AI inference, or data streaming.

Traditional payment systems often expose transaction details, user identities, or amounts on-chain, compromising privacy and enabling surveillance. While on the service-end it requires it to identify itself to the public.

HiddenPay solves this by combining [Railgun](https://github.com/Railgun-Community/wallet), a zero-knowledge privacy protocol for shielded Ethereum transactions with off-chain payment channels, creating a system where payments are efficient, anonymous, and unlinkable.

At its core, HiddenPay operates through a vault-like smart contract that accepts shielded WETH deposits. Users fund their Railgun wallets privately and issue "payment tickets", cryptographic proofs of micropayments that providers validate without on-chain interactions for each transaction.<br />
Only the designated Railgun address can claim aggregated funds, which are send directly to the shielded wallet. This design supports extreme privacy scenarios: providers can offer services anonymously (e.g., via TOR hidden services), and users pay without revealing their identity.

_end-to-end hidden payment_

[HiddenPay](https://github.com/nionis/hidden-payment-channels) started as a [submission](https://devspot.app/en/projects/542) for the [RealFi hackthon](https://www.fundingthecommons.io/hackathons).

## What's coming next

1. implement a transport-agnostic SDK to wallets, dapps, and services may easily integrate HiddenPay
2. implement transport plugins in order to make it much easier for developers to add it into their products
     - header-plugin: attaches tickets into headers (can be used TOR)
     - waku-plugin: use Waku for ticket relaying
4. add guardrails so a user may not leak any metadata funding their railgun wallet
5. refactor code which has been developed with the DEMO in mind rather than a real SDK
6. hardening in multiple areas: utilise railgun's broadcasters, improve vault contract, many more
